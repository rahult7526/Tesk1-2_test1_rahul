# Hardhat Ethereum Project

## Overview

This project is built using **Hardhat**, a development environment for building Ethereum smart contracts. The project demonstrates how to develop, test, and deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum network using Hardhat.

## Features

- **Smart Contract Development**: Write, test, and deploy Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Testing with Hardhat**: Use Hardhat's built-in testing framework for running unit tests on your smart contracts.
- **Local Ethereum Network**: Deploy and interact with smart contracts on a local Ethereum network or testnet.
- **Contract Verification**: Verify and publish contracts on Etherscan.

## Technologies Used

- **Solidity**: For writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Ethereum development environment for compiling, testing, and deploying smart contracts.
- **Ethereum**: Blockchain platform for smart contract deployment.
- **Ethers.js**: JavaScript library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
